<p>Bitcoin Core version 0.11.0 is now available from:</p>

<p><a href="https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.11.0/">https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.11.0/</a></p>

<p>This is a new major version release, bringing both new features and
bug fixes.</p>

<p>Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues</a></p>

<h1 id="upgrading-and-downgrading">Upgrading and downgrading</h1>

<h2 id="how-to-upgrade">How to Upgrade</h2>

<p>If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).</p>

<h2 id="downgrade-warning">Downgrade warning</h2>

<p>Because release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and
parallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not
backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are
received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or
other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work
anymore as a result of this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is
stored on disk, which earlier versions won’t support.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data
directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from
bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely
synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not
supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.</p>

<p>This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility. There are no
known problems when downgrading from 0.11.x to 0.10.x.</p>

<h1 id="important-information">Important information</h1>

<h2 id="transaction-flooding">Transaction flooding</h2>

<p>At the time of this release, the P2P network is being flooded with low-fee
transactions. This causes a ballooning of the mempool size.</p>

<p>If this growth of the mempool causes problematic memory use on your node, it is
possible to change a few configuration options to work around this. The growth
of the mempool can be monitored with the RPC command <code>getmempoolinfo</code>.</p>

<p>One is to increase the minimum transaction relay fee <code>minrelaytxfee</code>, which
defaults to 0.00001. This will cause transactions with fewer BTC/kB fee to be
rejected, and thus fewer transactions entering the mempool.</p>

<p>The other is to restrict the relaying of free transactions with
<code>limitfreerelay</code>. This option sets the number of kB/minute at which
free transactions (with enough priority) will be accepted. It defaults to 15.
Reducing this number reduces the speed at which the mempool can grow due
to free transactions.</p>

<p>For example, add the following to <code>bitcoin.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>minrelaytxfee=0.00005
limitfreerelay=5
</code></pre>

<p>More robust solutions are being worked on for a follow-up release.</p>

<h1 id="notable-changes">Notable changes</h1>

<h2 id="block-file-pruning">Block file pruning</h2>

<p>This release supports running a fully validating node without maintaining a copy
of the raw block and undo data on disk. To recap, there are four types of data
related to the blockchain in the bitcoin system: the raw blocks as received over
the network (blk???.dat), the undo data (rev???.dat), the block index and the
UTXO set (both LevelDB databases). The databases are built from the raw data.</p>

<p>Block pruning allows Bitcoin Core to delete the raw block and undo data once
it’s been validated and used to build the databases. At that point, the raw data
is used only to relay blocks to other nodes, to handle reorganizations, to look
up old transactions (if -txindex is enabled or via the RPC/REST interfaces), or
for rescanning the wallet. The block index continues to hold the metadata about
all blocks in the blockchain.</p>

<p>The user specifies how much space to allot for block &amp; undo files. The minimum
allowed is 550MB. Note that this is in addition to whatever is required for the
block index and UTXO databases. The minimum was chosen so that Bitcoin Core will
be able to maintain at least 288 blocks on disk (two days worth of blocks at 10
minutes per block). In rare instances it is possible that the amount of space
used will exceed the pruning target in order to keep the required last 288
blocks on disk.</p>

<p>Block pruning works during initial sync in the same way as during steady state,
by deleting block files “as you go” whenever disk space is allocated. Thus, if
the user specifies 550MB, once that level is reached the program will begin
deleting the oldest block and undo files, while continuing to download the
blockchain.</p>

<p>For now, block pruning disables block relay.  In the future, nodes with block
pruning will at a minimum relay “new” blocks, meaning blocks that extend their
active chain.</p>

<p>Block pruning is currently incompatible with running a wallet due to the fact
that block data is used for rescanning the wallet and importing keys or
addresses (which require a rescan.) However, running the wallet with block
pruning will be supported in the near future, subject to those limitations.</p>

<p>Block pruning is also incompatible with -txindex and will automatically disable
it.</p>

<p>Once you have pruned blocks, going back to unpruned state requires
re-downloading the entire blockchain. To do this, re-start the node with
-reindex. Note also that any problem that would cause a user to reindex (e.g.,
disk corruption) will cause a pruned node to redownload the entire blockchain.
Finally, note that when a pruned node reindexes, it will delete any blk???.dat
and rev???.dat files in the data directory prior to restarting the download.</p>

<p>To enable block pruning on the command line:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>-prune=N</code>: where N is the number of MB to allot for raw block &amp; undo data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Modified RPC calls:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>getblockchaininfo</code> now includes whether we are in pruned mode or not.</li>
  <li><code>getblock</code> will check if the block’s data has been pruned and if so, return an
error.</li>
  <li><code>getrawtransaction</code> will no longer be able to locate a transaction that has a
UTXO but where its block file has been pruned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pruning is disabled by default.</p>

<h2 id="big-endian-support">Big endian support</h2>

<p>Experimental support for big-endian CPU architectures was added in this
release. All little-endian specific code was replaced with endian-neutral
constructs. This has been tested on at least MIPS and PPC hosts. The build
system will automatically detect the endianness of the target.</p>

<h2 id="memory-usage-optimization">Memory usage optimization</h2>

<p>There have been many changes in this release to reduce the default memory usage
of a node, among which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accurate UTXO cache size accounting (#6102); this makes the option <code>-dbcache</code>
precise where this grossly underestimated memory usage before</li>
  <li>Reduce size of per-peer data structure (#6064 and others); this increases the
number of connections that can be supported with the same amount of memory</li>
  <li>Reduce the number of threads (#5964, #5679); lowers the amount of (esp.
virtual) memory needed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fee-estimation-changes">Fee estimation changes</h2>

<p>This release improves the algorithm used for fee estimation.  Previously, -1
was returned when there was insufficient data to give an estimate.  Now, -1
will also be returned when there is no fee or priority high enough for the
desired confirmation target. In those cases, it can help to ask for an estimate
for a higher target number of blocks. It is not uncommon for there to be no
fee or priority high enough to be reliably (85%) included in the next block and
for this reason, the default for <code>-txconfirmtarget=n</code> has changed from 1 to 2.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-disable-wallet-transaction-broadcast">Privacy: Disable wallet transaction broadcast</h2>

<p>This release adds an option <code>-walletbroadcast=0</code> to prevent automatic
transaction broadcast and rebroadcast (#5951). This option allows separating
transaction submission from the node functionality.</p>

<p>Making use of this, third-party scripts can be written to take care of
transaction (re)broadcast:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Send the transaction as normal, either through RPC or the GUI</li>
  <li>Retrieve the transaction data through RPC using <code>gettransaction</code> (NOT
<code>getrawtransaction</code>). The <code>hex</code> field of the result will contain the raw
hexadecimal representation of the transaction</li>
  <li>The transaction can then be broadcasted through arbitrary mechanisms
supported by the script</li>
</ul>

<p>One such application is selective Tor usage, where the node runs on the normal
internet but transactions are broadcasted over Tor.</p>

<p>For an example script see <a href="https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin-submittx">bitcoin-submittx</a>.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-stream-isolation-for-tor">Privacy: Stream isolation for Tor</h2>

<p>This release adds functionality to create a new circuit for every peer
connection, when the software is used with Tor. The new option,
<code>-proxyrandomize</code>, is on by default.</p>

<p>When enabled, every outgoing connection will (potentially) go through a
different exit node. That significantly reduces the chance to get unlucky and
pick a single exit node that is either malicious, or widely banned from the P2P
network. This improves connection reliability as well as privacy, especially
for the initial connections.</p>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> If a non-Tor SOCKS5 proxy is configured that supports
authentication, but doesn’t require it, this change may cause that proxy to reject
connections. A user and password is sent where they weren’t before. This setup
is exceedingly rare, but in this case <code>-proxyrandomize=0</code> can be passed to
disable the behavior.</p>

<h1 id="change-log">0.11.0 Change log</h1>

<p>Detailed release notes follow. This overview includes changes that affect
behavior, not code moves, refactors and string updates. For convenience in locating
the code changes and accompanying discussion, both the pull request and
